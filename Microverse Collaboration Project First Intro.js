/*
-We probably dont need to rush or feel stressed.

-Read our setup / getting ready sections.
We are instructed to do this part alone and with mics off.

-Check that screensharing and mics are working properly/are loud enough.

-Let me know if I am speaking to quickly or speaking too much?
(sorry for my coughing)

-I think we need to record the whole 2 days and upload to Youtube,
need to make sure this is working properly.
collecting the audio from both? Collecting both screens?

-Perhaps discuss what areas you feel very comfortable in (with respect to this project)
-What areas you feel less comfortable in.

-GitHub / code sharing  (open to suggestion here if you know of a better/cleaner/faster way to work on the same code).

-Perhaps one just start a general project quickly, just so the other can observe their approach/method?
-Discuss preferences for approach, IDE/editor, shortcuts etc.


-Discuss requirements and line them up to be sure they are all addressed by the end.
-Discuss resources and get them prepared (browser tabs open to those pages).

-Start a new project on GitHub
(will this be in just one of our accounts or does it have to be a shared account?)


-Take turns, the one coding should talk out lout about what they are doing.
-pausing for questions and comments, find rhythm.
-pausing if one spots a mistake or typo that breaks code.
-We might need to go slower so that the other can follow and comment properly?


-Maybe add extra features once the main part is done.
What things does any major website have?
  -Navbar
  -logo
  -footer
  -contact me section? (this is more complex than it sounds)
  -a couple interactive items to demonstrate a variety of types of function,

-Add comments throughout.
-Check for typos.


-Set general predicted timelines to keep us on track:
If we have 8am-5pm for two days. Then perhaps:
Day 1 - Noon: We should be putting some real code down by this point, at least foundation work / boilerplate code.
Day 1 - 2pm: We should be starting to check out the major requirements.
Day 1 - 4pm: Start reviewing, is our progress on track for the requirements?
             What was causing us problems?
             Anything we can do better / improve upon for Day 2 to make things smoother?
Day 2 - 8am: We should be addressing the major big requirements.
Day 2 - Noon: Start thinking about Final comments and polish.
